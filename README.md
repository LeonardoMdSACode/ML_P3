# Binary classfication problem with text data

1 - Data Pre-Processing (Pandas)

2 - Stemming (nltk)

3 - Transforming the data into numerical data (scikit-learn)

4 - Splitting the dataset (scikit-learn)
          Training model used was Logistic Regression, the evaluation used the accuracy score.
          
5 - Simple predictive test

Binary classfication with logistic regression, a very effective tool.
The code in Jupyter NB has been commented.
